# Simple React Project Seeder

Simple React Project Seeder is a command-line tool designed to help developers quickly bootstrap new React projects with a basic folder structure and initial files. It provides a simple way to set up the essential files and directories needed to start building a React application, allowing developers to focus on coding rather than manual project setup.

## Features

- **Project Initialization**: Create the basic folder structure for a React project with predefined directories such as `public`, `src`, and `config`.
- **Starter Files**: Automatically generate starter files for the `public` and `src` directories, including an `index.html` file in the `public` directory and an `index.js` file in the `src` directory.
- **Customization**: Easily customize the project name and add additional features or integrations as needed.
